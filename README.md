Implementation algorithms for solving Scheduling Problem. This task is NP but there are polynomial approximation algorithms which have solutions close to real of in initial task. I considered one variation and evaluated precision of approximation.

main.py - code for solution tasks corresponding to Scheduling Problem

Graphics.ipynb - code for visualization results which have got after launching main.py
